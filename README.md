A video game website with a heavy focus on images, transitions and some animation. The theme throughout the website isn't consistent overall, instead, I was curious to try different themes for different sections of the website.

Story section - The screen starts off black, and fades in once you've scrolled to a certain point on the story section. The arrow near the bottom animates on hover and, once clicked, will swipe to a different image with different text. You can then click back to return to the original page.

Explore section - A looping animation of different images, The word "Explore" animates upward when you scroll down to a certain point. This is clickable and once clicked will show 2 more images that can then be closed.

Characters section - inspired by a fighting game character select screen. You can hover over the different characters and the diamond will pop out a little and their name will slide into view.
